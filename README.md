# Welcome! We're [BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com).

Day in, day out, we're creating the world's leading mid-market commerce platform. _Core to that is a great set of APIs, which developers like you can use to build amazing commerce experiences._ 

This repository is used for communication related to upcoming APIs - RFCs, descriptions of future endpoints, and beta documentation.

At the moment, we're not running any public API betas, so this space is empty.

We've moved all V3 API documentation to [developer.bigcommerce.com](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api/v3/) - this is where you'll find documentation for most of the previous content of this repo. You can also sign up for email updates relevant to developers on the left side of [developer.bigcommerce.com](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api/guides/).
